# Noodle-Extensions-Template-File
Personal Template based of the original demo.js file from the Noodle Extensions Documentation. 


This is just a simplified version for people who don't really know javascript or coding and stuff. 
Includes a bunch of common copy/paste elemnts to the speed the workflow up a bit. I also added in a bunch of comments to explain what each (important) bit of the script does.  


If you haven't already, check out the original Documentaion, read through and refrence this frequently when working on your maps. The original stuff is MUCH more in-depth then what I have here. 

You can find the Examples and documention map here: https://github.com/Aeroluna/NoodleExtensions/tree/master/Documentation/examples/documentationMap
You can also find a list and example of all the animation properties here: https://github.com/Aeroluna/NoodleExtensions/blob/master/Documentation/AnimationDocs.md

UPDATE: For a detailed dive into the three different ways of animating in NE, check out my guide here: https://youtu.be/nMHaPJ8o-Jk
I highly recommend watching this even if you already have previous experience with Noodle Extensions. 

For those of you who are familiar with NE, or if you've already made a few maps with my (or someone else's) script, I recommend checking out ReMapper from Swifter. 
It's a Utility designed for making NE maps and offers MUCH more control and has a significantly more simplified workflow.
